## API Token-based Authentication (Coming Soon)

We are excited to introduce Token-based Authentication for our APIs, a feature that will significantly enhance the security and convenience of your interactions with Wagmix services. While it's not yet available, we want to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of what to expect when this feature becomes accessible.

### What is Token-based Authentication?

Token-based Authentication is an advanced method of authenticating API requests by using a unique token. This token will serve as a secure and efficient means of granting access to your Wagmix Exchange and Wagmix Coin accounts programmatically. Instead of using your API Secret Key for every request, you will exchange it for a short-lived token, reducing the risk associated with long-term key exposure.

### Key Benefits

Token-based Authentication offers several key benefits:

#### Enhanced Security

With Token-based Authentication, your API Secret Key is kept more secure. Tokens are short-lived and can be easily rotated, reducing the window of vulnerability.

#### Simplified Key Management

Say goodbye to the complexity of managing API Secret Keys for different environments or applications. Tokens streamline this process, making it easier to manage access.

#### Reduced Risk

In the event that your token is compromised, the potential damage is limited due to its short lifespan.

### How Token-based Authentication Works

Token-based Authentication operates through the following steps:

#### 1. Request a Token

To start, you'll make an initial request to exchange your API Secret Key for a temporary token.

#### 2. Use the Token

With the token in hand, you can make authenticated requests to our APIs. Tokens have a limited validity period, after which they expire and become invalid.

#### 3. Refresh as Needed

When your token expires, simply request a new one. This process allows you to maintain a high level of security while ensuring uninterrupted access.

### Integration Details

We are diligently working to implement Token-based Authentication into our API system. Once available, you will receive comprehensive documentation on how to integrate this feature into your applications and workflows. We aim to make the transition as seamless as possible for our users.

### Stay Informed

Keep an eye on our official announcements and API Documentation for updates on the availability of Token-based Authentication. We are committed to providing you with tools and features that enhance your experience with Wagmix Exchange and Wagmix Coin.

Thank you for choosing Wagmix, and we look forward to delivering this exciting addition to our API suite in the near future.
