## API Rate Limits (Coming Soon)

At Wagmix, we are committed to providing a smooth and reliable experience for our users and developers. To ensure fair usage and system stability, we are actively working on implementing rate limits for our APIs. This page provides comprehensive information about rate limits, why they are important, and what to expect when they are introduced.

### Why Rate Limits?

Rate limits are essential for several reasons:

1. **Preventing Abuse and Misuse:** Rate limits help prevent abuse and misuse of our APIs, ensuring that no single user or application monopolizes our resources.

2. **Ensuring Fair Access:** They guarantee fair access to resources for all users, whether you're a casual developer or a heavy user of our services.

3. **Maintaining Stability:** Rate limits are crucial for maintaining the stability and performance of our systems, preventing overloads and downtimes.

### What to Expect

When rate limits are introduced, you can anticipate the following:

#### Rate Limit Policies

We will define clear rate limit policies, specifying the number of requests allowed within a given timeframe. These policies will be documented comprehensively in our API documentation.

#### Request Quotas

Each API endpoint may have its own rate limits and request quotas based on the type of data or functionality it provides. For example, read-only endpoints may have higher limits than write endpoints to protect sensitive data.

#### Response Handling

Properly handle responses when rate limits are exceeded, including relevant error messages and status codes. Our API will provide informative error responses, helping you identify when you've reached your rate limits.

#### Monitoring Tools

Developers will have access to monitoring tools and resources to keep track of their API usage. We will provide detailed guides and examples on how to implement these monitoring tools effectively.

### Stay Informed

We understand that rate limits are crucial for planning and optimizing your integration with Wagmix. Rest assured, we are actively working on implementing rate limits, and we'll provide the following resources once they become available:

- Comprehensive Rate Limit Documentation: Detailed information on rate limits for each API endpoint.
- Examples and Best Practices: Real-world examples and best practices for handling rate limits in your applications.
- Monitoring and Analytics: Guides on setting up monitoring tools to keep your API usage in check.

In the meantime, if you have specific requirements or concerns regarding rate limits, please feel free to reach out to our support team. We value your feedback and aim to provide a seamless experience for all developers.
