Whether you prefer centralized exchanges (CEX), decentralized exchanges (DEX), DeFi applications, or our trusted partner platforms, we've got you covered.

### Staking on Centralized Exchanges (CEX):

Centralized exchanges like Wagmix Exchange offer a hassle-free way to stake your WGX tokens. Here's a detailed guide:

#### Step 1: Create an Account

If you haven't already, sign up for an account on [Wagmix Exchange](https://wagmix.io/signup).

#### Step 2: Deposit WGX

Transfer your WGX tokens from your wallet to your Wagmix Exchange account. You can do this by navigating to the "Wallet" or "Funding" section and selecting the deposit option.

#### Step 3: Select Staking

Navigate to the staking section within the exchange platform. This is typically found in the "Earn" or "Staking" section.

#### Step 4: Choose Your Staking Plan

Select your preferred staking plan based on your goals and risk tolerance. Some plans offer fixed rewards, while others may have variable rates. Study the options carefully before proceeding.

#### Step 5: Stake WGX

Confirm your staking choice and lock in your WGX tokens. Your staked tokens will contribute to the network's security and earn you rewards over time.

### Staking on Decentralized Exchanges (DEX):

For those who prefer decentralized options, staking on DEX platforms can be a rewarding experience. Here's a detailed guide:

#### Step 1: Access a DEX

Choose a reputable DEX compatible with WGX tokens. Popular choices include [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/) and [SushiSwap](https://sushi.com/).

#### Step 2: Connect Your Wallet

Connect your preferred Ethereum wallet to the DEX. Ensure it holds a balance of WGX tokens. This usually involves clicking a "Connect Wallet" button and selecting your wallet provider.

#### Step 3: Select the Staking Pool

Look for a staking pool that supports WGX tokens. These pools allow you to stake your tokens in exchange for rewards. You can usually find this option in the "Pools" or "Farm" section of the DEX.

#### Step 4: Stake and Confirm

Confirm your staking transaction through your wallet. Your WGX tokens are now actively participating in the network, earning rewards as a result.

### Staking on DeFi Applications:

If you're interested in exploring DeFi applications, consider staking your WGX tokens in liquidity pools or yield farming. Here's a detailed guide:

#### Step 1: Choose a DeFi Platform

Research and choose a DeFi platform that supports WGX tokens. Ensure it's secure and well-established. Some popular options include [Balancer](https://balancer.finance/) and [Compound](https://compound.finance/).

#### Step 2: Provide Liquidity

In liquidity pools, you'll provide an equal value of WGX and another cryptocurrency (usually ETH) to the pool. In return, you'll receive LP (Liquidity Provider) tokens representing your share. Follow the platform's instructions to add liquidity to the pool.

#### Step 3: Stake LP Tokens

Stake your LP tokens within the DeFi platform. This action will allow you to earn rewards, often in the form of fees collected by the liquidity pool. Look for the "Stake" or "Farm" section on the platform.

#### Step 4: Monitor and Compound

Keep an eye on your staked assets and rewards. You can often compound your earnings by reinvesting them. Check your DeFi platform regularly for opportunities to maximize your rewards.
