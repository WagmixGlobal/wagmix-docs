Understanding the token supply allocation of Wagmix Coin (WGX) is crucial for a transparent and well-structured ecosystem. In this comprehensive guide, we provide an in-depth overview of how tokens are distributed, utilized, and locked for future release within the Wagmix Coin ecosystem.

### Max Supply

**Fixed at 120,000,000 Tokens**: The maximum supply of WGX tokens is meticulously capped at 120,000,000. This intentional limit ensures a stable environment for our community, preventing excessive inflation.

### Total Supply

**All Tokens in Existence**: Total supply represents the entirety of WGX tokens ever created. This encompasses all tokens, including those initially distributed and those earmarked for specific purposes or locked for future release.

### Circulation

**Tokens Actively Traded**: Circulating supply includes tokens actively traded within the market. It does not account for tokens held in lockers, reserve wallets, or allocated for specific purposes until they are released following our emission schedule or release schedule.

### Allocation of Token Supply

#### Initial Launch (60% of Total Supply)

**72,000,000 Tokens**: The majority of WGX tokens, representing 60% of the total supply, was distributed during the initial launch. These tokens are actively circulating in the market and are available for trading.

#### Operations (20% of Total Supply)

**24,000,000 Tokens**: Tokens allocated for operational purposes, such as platform maintenance and day-to-day activities, remain outside of circulation. These tokens ensure the smooth functioning of our ecosystem.

#### Marketing (10% of Total Supply)

**12,000,000 Tokens**: Marketing tokens are reserved for promotional activities designed to enhance community engagement. They are not in circulation but will be used strategically to raise awareness about Wagmix Coin.

#### Team and Advisors (10% of Total Supply)

**12,000,000 Tokens**: Tokens allocated for our dedicated team members and advisors are held back from circulation. This allocation aligns their interests with the long-term success of the project.

### Tokens in Lockers for Future Release

Tokens allocated for Marketing, Team, and Development purposes are securely held in lockers. A portion of these tokens may be locked for future release while some remain accessible for immediate use. For instance:

- **Marketing**: Of the 12,000,000 Marketing tokens, a significant portion may be locked for strategic promotions, gradually released to support long-term marketing efforts. This ensures a sustained marketing presence.

- **Team and Advisors**: A portion of the 12,000,000 tokens allocated to Team and Advisors may be locked, aligning with performance milestones and project development. The gradual release of these tokens reflects the commitment of our team.

- **Development**: Similarly, tokens allocated for Development purposes may be locked for future use, supporting ongoing platform enhancements and innovation. These tokens are methodically released as development milestones are achieved.

Understanding the intricate dynamics of token allocation and locking provides transparency within our ecosystem. As we move forward, tokens held in lockers may be released in a controlled manner according to our emission schedule or release schedule, fostering a secure and well-managed environment.
