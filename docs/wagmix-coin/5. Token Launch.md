## Wagmix Coin (WGX) - Power to the People

At Wagmix, we stand for transparency, fairness, and community involvement. The launch of Wagmix Coin (WGX) is a testament to our commitment to these core values.

### Initial Launch on Uniswap V2

Wagmix Coin (WGX) will have its inaugural launch through a fair and decentralized process on Uniswap V2. This approach allows anyone in the crypto community to participate, ensuring equal opportunities for all.

#### Why Uniswap V2?

Uniswap V2 provides a decentralized and trustless platform for token swaps. Here's how you can participate in the initial launch:

**Step 1:** Visit Uniswap V2's interface.

**Step 2:** Connect your crypto wallet.

**Step 3:** Navigate to the WGX token pair.

**Step 4:** Swap your preferred cryptocurrency for WGX tokens.

Our dedication to decentralization means that no single entity will have an unfair advantage during this launch.

### 1-Week Delay to Wagmix Exchange

Following the initial Uniswap V2 launch, there will be a 1-week delay before Wagmix Coin (WGX) becomes available on Wagmix Exchange. This delay period serves multiple important purposes:

#### 1. Clarity

It offers time for the market to absorb the new token and establish a fair market price before trading on our exchange. This ensures that price discovery is fair and transparent.

#### 2. Transparency

We strive for transparency in all our actions. The delay period helps us maintain transparency and ensures that the launch on Wagmix Exchange is smooth and equitable for all users.

#### 3. Community Control

During this period, the community has a significant say in determining the token's value and trading dynamics. It aligns with our commitment to community governance.

### Fair and Decentralized

Our launch strategy reflects our unwavering dedication to decentralization and community governance. Wagmix Coin (WGX) isn't about privileged access; it's about empowering the entire community.
