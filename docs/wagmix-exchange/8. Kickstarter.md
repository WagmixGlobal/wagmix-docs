## Shape the Future of Crypto Listings

Welcome to Wagmix Exchange's Kickstarter, where the power to shape the future of crypto listings is in your hands. We believe in decentralization and community-driven decision-making. That's why we've created Kickstarter, a unique platform where projects can earn their listing through a democratic process fueled by your engagement.

### How Does Kickstarter Work?

Kickstarter is designed to give the crypto community a voice in determining which projects get listed on Wagmix Exchange. Here's how it works:

#### 1. Project Submissions

Crypto projects interested in being listed on Wagmix Exchange can submit their applications to the Kickstarter platform. This is the first step for projects seeking listing on our exchange.

#### 2. Community Engagement

Once a project is submitted, it's time for the community to get involved. As a community member, you have the opportunity to:

- **Vote:** Support your favorite projects by voting for them.
- **Provide Feedback:** Engage in discussions and provide feedback to show your support for the projects you believe in.

Community engagement is a crucial element in determining which projects gain listing approval.

#### 3. Deposit Campaigns

Projects must demonstrate their commitment to our platform by initiating deposit campaigns. These campaigns serve as a way for projects to prove their worthiness through real engagement and commitment from their community. Deposit campaigns showcase the level of community support behind a project.

#### 4. Listing Criteria

To qualify for listing, projects need to meet specific listing criteria, which may include:

- A minimum number of votes from the community.
- Successful completion of deposit campaigns.
- High levels of community engagement and support.

Meeting these criteria is essential for a project to move closer to gaining listing approval.

#### 5. Listing Approval

When a project successfully meets the criteria and gains significant community support, Wagmix Exchange approves the listing. This makes the project available for trading on our platform, driven by genuine community demand and engagement.

### Why Kickstarter?
