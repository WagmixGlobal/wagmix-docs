## Referral Program Guide

Welcome to the Wagmix Referral Program! Our program offers a multi-level structure that rewards you for referring new customers or traders to our platform. Here's a comprehensive breakdown of our referral program settings:

### Referral Depth

Our Referral Program operates on a multi-level structure, allowing you to earn rewards through a network of referrals. The key elements include:

#### Maximum Affiliation Level

The depth of your referral network, which can have up to three levels of referrals. This means you can earn commissions not only from directly referred users but also from users referred by your referrals.

### Commission Rewards - General

We offer competitive commission rates for your referral efforts. These commissions are based on the level of affiliation within your referral network:

#### Level 1 (%)

Earn a 1% commission for directly referring a customer or user to our program. When you refer someone, and they sign up or make transactions on our platform, you receive a 1% commission on their activities.

#### Level 2 (%)

Level 2 affiliates, referred by Level 1 affiliates, receive a 2% commission for their referrals. This means that if someone you referred (Level 1) refers another user (Level 2), you earn a 2% commission on the activities of the Level 2 affiliate.

#### Level 3 (%)

Level 3 affiliates, referred by Level 2 affiliates or further down the chain, get a 4% commission for their referrals. If the Level 2 customer (referred by Level 1) refers yet another user (Level 3), you will earn a 4% commission on the Level 3 affiliate's activities.

### How It Works

Let's break down how the referral program works with an example:

1. **Affiliate A (You):** You directly refer a customer to our platform and become a Level 1 affiliate, earning a 1% commission on their activities.

2. **Level 2 Affiliate:** If the customer referred by Affiliate A decides to refer another customer (Level 2), the Level 2 affiliate (referred by Affiliate A) earns a 2% commission on their referrals.

3. **Level 3 Affiliate:** If the Level 2 customer decides to refer yet another customer (Level 3), the Level 3 affiliate will earn a 4% commission on their referrals.

### Trade Referral Settings

We also have specific settings for our trade referral program, which focuses on trading and financial services:

#### Maximum Affiliation Level (Referral Depth)

Our trade referral program is also set to a maximum depth of 3, allowing a multi-level referral structure for trading-related referrals.

#### Level 1 (%)

Level 1 affiliates in our trade referral program receive a 1% commission for directly referring a new trader or investor to our program.

#### Level 2 (%)

Level 2 affiliates, referred by Level 1 affiliates, earn a 2% commission for their referrals within the trade referral program.

#### Level 3 (%)

Level 3 affiliates, referred by Level 2 affiliates or further down the chain, receive a 4% commission for their referrals within the trade referral program.
