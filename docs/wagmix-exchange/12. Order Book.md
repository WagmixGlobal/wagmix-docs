### What is the Order Book?

The Order Book is a real-time display of all buy and sell orders for a particular cryptocurrency. It's essentially a ledger that shows the demand (buy orders) and supply (sell orders) for a specific trading pair. Each order is listed with details such as price, quantity, and order type (market or limit).

#### How to Interpret the Order Book

- **Buy Orders (Bids):** These represent the prices at which traders are willing to purchase a cryptocurrency. The highest bid is usually listed at the top. Traders who believe the price will decrease may place buy orders at lower prices.

- **Sell Orders (Asks):** These indicate the prices at which traders are looking to sell their cryptocurrency. The lowest ask is typically displayed at the top. Sellers expecting a price increase may set higher ask prices.

#### Order Book Depth

The depth of the Order Book refers to the number of buy and sell orders at various price levels. Deeper Order Books typically indicate higher liquidity, making it easier to execute large orders without significant price fluctuations.

#### Using the Order Book for Trading

Traders use the Order Book to:

- Identify support and resistance levels.
- Gauge market sentiment based on the balance of buy and sell orders.
- Determine potential entry and exit points for trades.

#### Real-time Updates
