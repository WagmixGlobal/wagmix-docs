## Empower Your Favorite Projects

At Wagmix Exchange, we believe in the power of community-driven decisions. With our "Vote to List" initiative, you have the opportunity to influence the future of crypto trading. Here's how it works:

### The Community's Voice

Every week, promising blockchain projects vie for a spot on Wagmix Exchange. These projects can be new tokens, innovative DeFi solutions, or groundbreaking blockchain ventures. It's your chance to support the projects you believe in.

### How It Works

#### 1. Project Submissions

- Projects seeking to get listed on Wagmix Exchange can [submit their proposals](https://t.me/WagmixGlobalProposalsBot).

#### 2. Community Engagement

- The community gets to review and vote for their favorite projects. Engage in discussions, ask questions, and show your support.

#### 3. Weekly Showdown

- At the end of the week, the project with the most votes, combined with meeting the minimum requirements, secures a listing spot on Wagmix Exchange.
