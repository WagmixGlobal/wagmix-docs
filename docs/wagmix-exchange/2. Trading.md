### Profit, Loss, and ROI

Understanding your profit, loss, and return on investment (ROI) is essential for effective trading. Here's how you can calculate and track these metrics on Wagmix Exchange:

1. **Profit and Loss (P&L)**: Your profit or loss is determined by the difference between the purchase price and the current market price of the asset. To calculate:
   - Profit: Current asset price minus purchase price.
   - Loss: Purchase price minus current asset price.

2. **Return on Investment (ROI)**: ROI measures the profitability of your investment. It's calculated as:
   - ROI (%) = (Profit / Investment Cost) x 100

By monitoring your P&L and ROI, you can assess the performance of your trades and make informed decisions.
