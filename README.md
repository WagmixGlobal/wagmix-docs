## Generating Markdown Files from Solidity Natspec Comments

To generate markdown files from Solidity Natspec comments, you can use the following command:

```sh
$ yarn docgen
```

If you want to generate markdown files with local contract files, you can try yarn docgen:local.

## Adding a New Page

To add a new page to the documentation, follow these steps:

- Create a markdown file in its respective directory.
- Add your content to the markdown file.


## Installation

To get started with the documentation locally, you can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```sh
$ yarn
```

## Local Development

For local development, use the following command to start a local development server and open a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

```sh
$ yarn start
```

## Build
To generate static content for deployment into the build directory, use the following command:

```sh
$ yarn build
```

This generated content can be served using any static content hosting service.

This revised README.md provides a clearer structure and explanations for contributing, generating markdown files from Solidity Natspec comments, and adding new pages to the documentation. It also includes installation and local development instructions.
